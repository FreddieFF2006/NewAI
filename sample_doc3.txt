        Claude API and Language Models
        
        Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic. It excels at:
        - Natural conversations and question answering
        - Analysis and reasoning tasks
        - Code generation and debugging
        - Creative writing and content creation
        
        The Claude API provides programmatic access to Claude's capabilities.
        It uses a messages-based API similar to chat interfaces.
        
        RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines:
        1. Information retrieval from a knowledge base
        2. Language model generation based on retrieved context
        
        This approach reduces hallucinations and provides source attribution.
