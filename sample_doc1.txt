        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
        Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
        
        Common applications include:
        - Natural Language Processing for understanding text
        - Computer Vision for image recognition
        - Recommendation systems for personalized content
        - Autonomous vehicles for self-driving cars
        
        The field has grown exponentially since 2010, with major breakthroughs in
        transformers, large language models, and generative AI.
