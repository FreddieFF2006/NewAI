        Vector Databases and Embeddings
        
        Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling semantic search.
        Unlike traditional databases that use exact keyword matching, vector databases
        understand the meaning and context of queries.
        
        Popular vector databases include:
        - Qdrant: High-performance vector search engine
        - Pinecone: Managed vector database service
        - Weaviate: Open-source vector search engine
        - Milvus: Scalable vector database
        
        Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
        Models like E5-large-v2 create embeddings that enable similarity search.
        Cosine similarity is commonly used to measure vector similarity.
